# General commentary
# ------------------
#
# Steps that are less likely to fail should come later, because failing earlier
# saves time and resources. For example, `cabal check` should come after `cabal
# build`, because edits to the Cabal file are generally more rare than edits to
# Haskell source files.

    # Note [Parallelism]
    # ------------------
    #
    # We split the build into two steps:
    #
    # - Build only the dependencies. Build them in parallel at the package level
    #   (which is Cabal's default, see haskell/cabal#5776).
    # - Build this project (a single package). Use --ghc-options=-j (in the
    #   `configure` step) to build local packages' modules in parallel.
    #
    # This scheme maximizes the use of parallelism while avoiding
    # oversubscription. See GHC proposal #540 for additional background. It would
    # be nice to replace this with `cabal configure --semaphore`, but this only
    # became available with GHC 9.8. To support older versions, we don't use it
    # just yet.

    # Build the Haddocks to ensure that they are well formed. Somewhat

    # for the top-level library, but do not build dependencies with Haddocks".
    # The upshot is that we do not change the build configuration for any
    # dependencies, which means that we don't have to rebuild them. The downside
    # is that the rendered Haddocks won't contain any links to identifiers from
    # library dependencies. Since we are only building Haddocks to ensure well-
    # formedness, we consider this an acceptable tradeoff.

    # be available alongside the supported versions of GHC.
